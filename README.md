# ktools: An R Package with useful functions

## Summary

This repository will host both the development and the production version of the package. There are no plans to commit to CRAN. It implements some useful functions and is manly for my personal use.

## Installation Instructions
Assuming you already have R installed (if not see http://www.r-project.org/),
to installed, you can install the most recent development version using the devtools package.

```
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kudusch/ktools")
```

Note that this will install the `devtools` package and the `ktools` package.
